What are oops concepts? Is multiple inheritance supported in java 

-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain both data and methods 
that operate on the data. OOP provides a way to structure code to make it reusable, scalable, and maintainable. 

-The key OOP concepts are:
1.Class: A blueprint for creating objects.

2.Object: An instance of a class 

3.Inheritance: When one class inherits properties from another 

4.Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods together and controlling access .

5.Polymorphism: The ability to use a single interface for different data types .

6.Abstraction: Hiding complex details and showing only the essentials



-No, Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes. This means a class can't inherit from more than one class
