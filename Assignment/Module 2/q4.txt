How memory is managed in Python?

1. Garbage Collection: Garbage collection is a process in which the interpreter frees up the memory when not in use to make it 
available for other objects.

2. Reference counting: Reference counting works by counting the number of times an object is referenced by other objects in the system.
When references to an object are removed, the reference count for an object is decremented. When the reference count becomes zero,
the object is deallocated.


EXAMPLE:
When x = 10 is executed an integer object 10 is created in memory and its reference is assigned to variable x, this is because everything is 
object in Python.
