#How Many Basic Types Of Functions Are Available In Python?
"""
1. Built-in Functions: These are functions that are pre-defined in Python and can be used directly. Examples include print(), len(), 
type(), int(), str(), etc.

2. User-defined Functions: These are functions that you define yourself using the def keyword. They allow you to encapsulate code for
 reuse.

3.Lambda Functions: These are small anonymous functions defined with the lambda keyword. They can take any number of arguments but
only have one expression.

4.Recursive Functions: These are functions that call themselves in order to solve a problem. They are often used for tasks that can
be divided into smaller subproblems.
